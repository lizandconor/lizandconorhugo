We are very lucky to have friends and family travelling from near and far to celebrate with us, and your presence is the perfect gift!!

However we have been asked by a few guests for gift ideas. We would be very grateful for contributions towards our honeymoon or our upcoming home renovations (both are currently in the planning stages!). We have also prepared a wedding registry with Hudson's Bay department store which you can access [here](https://registry.thebay.com/registry/view-registry/liz_and_conor).
