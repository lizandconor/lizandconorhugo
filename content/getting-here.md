## Electronic Travel Authorization
Guests coming from Ireland, the UK and other [visa-exempt countries](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html) will need an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA).
The official application form on the Government of Canada website is here:

 * https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta/apply-passport-information.html.

The application process costs CAD $7 and only takes a few minutes.
Beware of third party websites who charge a higher fee for the same service.

Further information on the eTA is available on the Government of Canada website here:
