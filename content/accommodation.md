There are a lot of great accommodation options in Victoria --- here are a few suggestions.
Note that the Friday night drinks will be in downtown Victoria,
and on Saturday we will arrange a bus from the DoubleTree hotel to the Beach House and back.

## DoubleTree by Hilton
We have arranged a 15% discount for wedding guests at the [DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Victoria](http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/british-columbia/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-and-suites-victoria-YYJDSDT/index.html) between 25-29 April.
The discount is applied to the best available rate at the time of booking, using [this booking link](https://secure3.hilton.com/en_US/dt/reservation/book.htm?ctyhocn=YYJDSDT&corporateCode=0002667015&from=lnrlink) or by calling +1 250 940 3106 with the reference *'P99 rate on April 25, 2019'*.

## Quality Inn
We have arranged a discounted rate of CAD $138 (including 16% tax) per room at the [Quality Inn](http://www.victoriaqualityinn.com) in downtown Victoria.
To book, call +1 800 661 4115 and give the reference *'Fleming-Williams wedding'*.

## Airbnb
[Airbnb](www.airbnb.com) is a good resource for finding a house or apartment to rent while you are in Victoria.
Aim for locations within a 10-15 minute drive from Victoria Inner Harbour.
The taxi fare for a 15 minute journey should be CAD $15-20.
It is customary to tip taxi drivers by around 10% of the fare.
