There are a lot of great accommodation options in Victoria --- we recommend booking early to get the best rates!

Note that the Friday night drinks will be in downtown Victoria,
and on Saturday night we will arrange a bus from the Beach House back to the city centre.

## Airbnb
[Airbnb](www.airbnb.com) is a good resource for finding a house or apartment to rent while you are in Victoria.
Aim for locations within a 10-15 minute drive from Victoria Inner Harbour.
The taxi fare for a 15 minute journey should be CAD $15-20.
It is customary to tip taxi drivers by around 10% of the fare.

## DoubleTree by Hilton
We have arranged a 15% discount for wedding guests at the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel & Suites Victoria between 25-29 April.
The rate is applied to the best available rate at the time of booking, using [this booking link](https://secure3.hilton.com/en_US/dt/reservation/book.htm?ctyhocn=YYJDSDT&corporateCode=0002667015&from=lnrlink) or by calling +1 250 940 3106 with the reference 'P99 rate on April 25, 2019'.
